# Project Title: RackeTwitter

### Statement
The point of this project is to create an app for twitter in racket.  It will use a GUI and the FORGETLIBNAME library to allow the user to login to their Twitter account, tweet and retweet, and search for specific hashtags.  It will be interesting to see how racket can be used to create such an app.  

### Analysis
We will be using Map, filter, and reduce to parse the data we recieve from the twitter server.  I will also be using data abstraction to protect the password. 

### Data set or other source materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
By the end of this project we want to be able to demo an app that allows the user to connect to their twitter acount, look up specific hashtags, and tweet/retweet.  For the live demo we could log into an acount and tweet something.  We can then prove it worked by showing the tweet on the twitter website.


What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
A brief expectation of our results would be that user is able to post a tweet to their account and then go and view that tweet on another
brower or application. For quantitative search results we will be comparing our results of a hashtag search to that of a hashtag search
on twitter's website. 

## Architecture Diagram
![Diag](https://github.com/oplS16projects/RackeTwitter/blob/master/workflowDiagram.png)

The diagram shows that the user will input their data which will then be sent to the twitter data base throught racket making use of the OAuth racket Library. Then we will make api calls in racket using 
```
procedure
(post-pure-port URL post [header]) → input-port?
  URL : url?
  post : bytes?
  header : (listof string?) = null
```
and then when the data is sent back from twitter we will need to parse it as it will be returned in the JSON format. Here we will need to use the JSON racket library. After Parsing the data, it will be displayed to the user in the gui. 

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
The basic GUI should be set up for testing and allow the user to give their username and password.

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
The GUI will allow the user to login to twitter and make a basic post.  I also want the password to be hidden when it is typed in.

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
By this time the GUI should be cleaned up and should allow the user to search for specific hashtags and retweet.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

### Harrison Desjardins @HTDesjardins
I will be working on the GUI portion of the project.  I hope by the first milestone to have a basic gui with a login screen that will take a username and password.  By the second milestone I want to have the gui allowing the user to login with their password being hidden when typed and I would like the user to be able to post tweets.  By the final milestone I would like to have the gui set up for the search and retweet functions.  I would also want to clean it up and make it look nice by this point.

### Nick Finocchiaro @nickfinocchiaro
Nick will be working on the backend of the project. This includes working with the OAuth Racket library as well as creating a new
twitter app to obtain the access tokens needed to communicate with the database. This library allows us to securely connect to twitter
and query the data base for tweets as well as post them. For the first milestone, I hope to have a working login screen that will accept
the user's account name and password and successfully log them in. Second milestone will be that the user is able to post a tweet. The
Final milestone is that the user can seach a hashtag and have the results returned to the gui. Twitter will return all query's in JSON
format so I will also need to be implementing a JSON parser to make the ouput readable for the common user.
